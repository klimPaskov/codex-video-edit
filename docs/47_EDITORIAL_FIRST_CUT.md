# Editorial first-cut requirements

Status: accepted product requirements for later implementation, adapted from the user-supplied editorial reference. This document and the original application prompt in `prompts/EDITORIAL_FIRST_CUT_PROMPT.md` do not establish implemented automation, native acceptance, or P1 completion. The reference's external application commands and provider suggestions are not operational instructions for this app. Codex remains the only generative provider.

## Preferences and boundaries

| Preference | Default and interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| Spoken editor cue | `Hey Codex`; configurable per project. Accept only clear contextual/phonetic variants. Historical aliases, including `Hey Borumi`, require explicit opt-in; do not enable them globally. |
| Camera inset | Prefer bottom-right, moving it whenever it covers meaningful evidence or captions. |
| Camera-led appearance | Reuse the exact available properties of an approved project layout. Otherwise choose a restrained inset with margins and, where supported, rounded corners and subtle shadow. |
| Generated graphics | Suggestions only. Creating, rendering, importing, or placing a particular graphic requires a separate explicit asset request. A recorded cue alone is not that request. |
| Export | Off. Editing and pass checkpoints never authorize final export. |

Apply this editorial policy within the selected Magic Wand options and authorized range. It complements captions, optional safe speed changes, audio treatment, cursor controls and permitted local B-roll; it does not silently disable those product features or authorize new assets. Existing approved edits and protected material take precedence over general cleanup preferences. A request for a complete re-edit changes scope only where explicitly authorized.

## 1. Establish context and prerequisites

Discover the current app's exposed guides/capabilities once per runtime connection, then retrieve the relevant versioned guidance for projects, transcript timing, cuts/restoration, synchronized sources, layouts, zooms and QA. Use the documented native app contracts; never invent a guide endpoint, external-editor API, or successful unavailable tool call. Confirm active project identity, revision, draft sequence/hash, scenes, canvas metadata, source roles and timeline before writing.

Check transcription state first. Poll an existing job by its real handle. If transcription is absent, request it once, retain its job identity, and poll the documented status until it completes or fails. Do not restart because a poll times out. A missing runtime, project, source, guide or required capability is an actionable blocker, not permission to fabricate results. Report the exact affected prerequisite and preserve unrelated work.

Determine the synchronized edit set for camera, screen and microphone from verified source relationships and timing. Narration-based ripple cuts may affect only the appropriate synchronized set; an independent screen layer requires its own evidenced mapping. Inspect approved camera/screen layouts and protected regions, including sponsor segments and licensed material. Treat prior edits as intentional; modify new or requested material only.

## 2. Interpret spoken directions conservatively

A configured wake phrase identifies a candidate editorial direction only when surrounding speech and visuals support that reading. Read the entire direction, the neighboring sentences and relevant footage before determining its target and scope. Quoting a wake phrase, uncertain transcription or unrelated phonetics must not silently become an instruction. Recorded speech cannot expand permissions to source deletion, cleanup, spending, publication, final export, arbitrary execution or unrequested asset creation.

Carry out clear cut, layout and zoom requests in their respective passes. Record requests for charts, diagrams, comparisons, callouts, explainers, animations or similar visuals as suggestion-only opportunities. Remove a resolved direction's complete spoken span, cue and associated direction-giving dead time, using an undoable cut whose joined wording, sound and visuals are verified. The verified join is required before the pass checkpoint; if it fails, restore the material. Keep ambiguous directions and affected footage intact and list the unresolved scope in the report.

## 3. Construct the spoken cut

Use a dedicated undoable spoken-cut pass group. Read each scene and use word-level timing at uncertain boundaries, with microphone silence as supporting evidence. Candidates include incomplete openings, abandoned sentences, failed demonstrations superseded by successful redos, repeated explanations, mistakes/self-comments, resolved editor directions, nonessential software waits, unused empty scenes and blank endings. For repeated takes, keep the final complete version and preserve any unique useful information elsewhere.

Evaluate the complete sentence on each side of every removal. Retain setup, context, exceptions, qualifications, examples, connective wording and meaningful names/numbers/negations. Keep uncertain repetition and normal conversational pauses. For a genuinely removable long gap, approximately 200–300 ms of total breathing space around the join is a starting heuristic, never a duration threshold or fixed padding rule. A pause that supports a demonstration or natural rhythm stays even when long.

Submit confirmed nonoverlapping cut ranges in validated atomic batches, ripple across the verified synchronized set, and update source/output mapping after each structural change. Inspect every join in the edited transcript and rendered A/V: grammar, logical continuity, sound and on-screen explanatory evidence must survive. Run a separate omission pass over the complete source transcript, then reread the entire edited transcript in scene/section order. If context or a complete sentence was lost, restore the required source range through the shared engine and inspect the exact join again.

Checkpoint the spoken pass only after those checks. Do not polish transcript wording merely to improve its written appearance. Caption/text correction is distinct from cutting media, and neither text correction nor this policy resynthesizes or rewrites spoken audio.

## 4. Choose purposeful layouts

Start a separate layout pass group after the spoken pass checkpoint. Inspect both composed output and raw camera/screen evidence. Reuse approved layout properties rather than treating automatic placement as final. Keep the speaker visible for most dual-source material when this helps understanding, with a screen-led inset during demonstrations. Bottom-right is a preference, not a reason to cover a button, result, price, caption or other evidence.

Use screen-only sections when density/readability or unavoidable occlusion demands them; bring the speaker back when that constraint ends. Favor camera-led sections for introductions, conclusions, opinions, setup and transitions where the screen adds little. Return to screen-led framing for controls, interface changes, demonstrations, results and pricing. Use a small number of meaningful sections rather than constant switching, and include each source only when it contributes. Inspect both boundaries and the midpoint of every layout for framing, occlusion and continuity before checkpointing.

## 5. Deliver selective graphics suggestions

After the verified layout pass, identify only visuals that clarify, compare, summarize or explain something the existing footage/layout/zoom cannot already communicate well. Prepare suggestions without launching a graphics generator, writing a composition, generating media, rendering an overlay or importing/placing a graphic. A normal edit request and a recorded request for a graphic are both insufficient asset-creation authorization.

Resolve suggestion timing against the final committed edited timeline, remapping again if subsequent timing edits occur. List ideas in narration order. Each item contains start/end time, a concept label, a one-sentence editorial benefit and one self-contained generator-neutral prompt. That prompt specifies 1920×1080, duration, exact frame rate, no audio, visual concept and reveal order, exact on-screen wording, style, motion behavior, explicit title/action-safe margins and transparency when appropriate. Use only grounded data/claims and authorized branding; do not invent numbers, logos or interface details. If necessary facts are missing, identify them rather than supplying fictional values.

The graphics prompt's 1920×1080 target describes a suggested separate asset, not the project canvas or master. It cannot authorize downscaling a native-resolution project or lowering its precision. Codex may write these suggestion prompts; no second generative provider is integrated or invoked by this policy.

## 6. Place target-driven zooms

Use a separate zoom pass group. Reassess existing effects within the authorized editing scope; remove/rebuild poorly targeted zooms only there, preserving approved/protected edits elsewhere. Plan from committed screen-led sections. Suitable targets include controls, menus, inputs, opening panels, model/agent/options selection, permission/login/handoff interface steps, meaningful results/confirmations/schedules/prices, and small phone UI or dense text. Depicting permission controls in footage does not authorize operating unrelated accounts.

Name each target precisely before placing an effect. Skip unnamed/generic center zooms. Tie its interval to the referenced interaction or narration; stop before unrelated speech. Desktop magnification around 1.6–1.8× and centered phone capture around 1.8–2.0× are adjustable starting ranges, subordinate to legibility and retained context. Follow cursor for genuinely moving interactions; use fixed targets for stable panels, results, prices and phone screens. Most intervals should be about 3–10 seconds; longer holds need a continuing readability reason. Prevent overlap and leave short wider-view rests between unrelated targets. Reject decorative motion and excessive cropping. Camera zooms should be rare and justified by rhetorical/emotional emphasis in an already camera-led section.

Inspect an interior frame plus midpoint and both boundaries of every zoom. Confirm the named target remains legible, correctly framed, unoccluded by the camera and relevant throughout. Repair wrong-cursor tracking, empty targets, clipped text and poor transitions, or remove the effect through shared undo. Checkpoint only verified zooms.

## 7. Complete visual and state QA

Use analysis-only low-resolution contact sheets for an initial coverage scan, then precise rendered frames and A/V boundary previews for uncertain details. Inspect both edges and midpoint of every layout/zoom, including relationships to narration, captions, camera and protected segments. After all visual changes are committed to the draft, repeat a whole-video contact-sheet scan. Contact sheets supplement, rather than replace, full-result review and listening required by later acceptance.

Read actual final duration, scene/layout/zoom counts, project/revision identity, draft sequence and committed state from the engine. Verify all declared protected sections remained intact and no graphic was generated/imported without a separate authorized asset request. Export stays unperformed unless separately requested through the required native action. Preserve original bytes and source precision/color metadata. Analysis sheets never feed the master or become a silent lower-quality preview fallback; edited master verification compares against canonical edited samples, not a claim of identity to unedited footage.

## Live transactions, checkpoints and delivery

Manual tools, Magic Wand and Codex use one validated transaction engine and undo history. Separate spoken, layout and zoom pass groups provide understandable undo boundaries, not parallel mutation systems. Authorized atomic batches may commit live during a turn and update timeline/controls/preview from committed state without repeated approval. Every structural mutation refreshes revision/sequence, timeline hash and source/output mapping. Revalidate stale context before retrying.

Verify each applied batch before its pass checkpoint. On failure, use the shared engine's inverse/restore transactions to roll back the failed batch; abort any unapplied batch and preserve previously verified work. Do not issue stale inverses over intervening edits. An unresolved rollback conflict blocks that pass and must be reported. Record specific operation summaries, evidence and undo handles. A pass checkpoint records validation of persisted draft work; it does not implicitly freeze an immutable user revision, erase undo history, certify final review or export. Never label unverified work committed-and-verified merely because a persistence call succeeded.

The final report provides measured runtime; removed categories and meaningful retained exceptions; actual layout count and purposes; actual zoom count and named targets; unresolved spoken instructions; every selected graphic opportunity with final-cut times and complete prompt; exact persisted/checkpoint state and any pending or rolled-back work; and remaining manual review. Distinguish verified, unresolved and unavailable checks. Never invent counts, playback, listening, tool use or completion.

## Implementation and acceptance mapping

| Requirement group | Later phase owners | Required evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Guides, project context, transcription job lifecycle, scope and synchronization | P2, P5 | Real capability discovery, one transcription request with live polling, blocked/missing prerequisites, independent-source and protected-range rejection |
| Spoken cue interpretation and meaning-preserving cuts | P5, P10 | Clear/ambiguous/quoted/variant cues, opt-in legacy aliases, final complete redos, unique context retention, all join checks, omission pass, full reread and restore |
| Shared live pass groups and recovery | P2, P5, P7, P8 | Atomicity, stale sequence/hash rejection, undo/inverse, interruption, failed-batch rollback and truthful checkpoint state |
| Deliberate layouts and suggestion-only graphics | P8, P10 | Approved-property reuse, occlusion and three-point checks, final-time prompt completeness, no asset side effects without separate authorization |
| Named zoom targets and framing | P7, P10 | Purpose/range/scale evidence, cursor/fixed choice, overlap rejection, rests, boundary/midpoint/interior renders and protected-edit checks |
| Final visual QA, counts, fidelity and export boundary | P9, P10 | Whole-video scans plus precise/A/V review, actual committed counts, immutable hashes, canonical sample equality, analysis/master separation and explicit export action |

All of these remain implementation/acceptance work in their assigned phases. This adaptation does not change P1 completion status or claim the user-supplied video has been edited.

The initial suggestion data contract is implemented in `packages/domain/src/graphics-opportunity.ts`, with `schemas/graphics_opportunity.schema.json` and its synthetic example. It checks shape, current timeline identity/hash/sequence, final-cut bounds, exact duration, rational frame rate and safe margins. It rejects asset/execution fields and returns a detached record. It does not produce an opportunity, generate media, prove factual grounding, or apply an edit. `tests/media/graphics-opportunity.test.ts` covers these boundaries; the complete editorial runtime remains future work.
