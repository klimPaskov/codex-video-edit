# Automatic zoom specification

## Goal

Guide attention to meaningful screen actions without constant motion.

## Evidence order

1. Recorded click and pointer telemetry
2. Declared scene or user markers
3. Visible cursor and UI change analysis
4. Codex review of sampled frames and transcript context

Low-confidence imported footage uses fewer or no automatic zooms.

## Candidate generation

Create candidates around clicks, text entry, menu selection, key reveals, and small controls that would otherwise be hard to see. Exclude ordinary cursor travel, long narration over a static screen without a continuing readability need, and repeated nearby actions that would cause zoom pumping.

## Motion rules

- Target a visible UI region, not an arbitrary point.
- Add padding around the target.
- Keep target inside safe bounds throughout motion.
- Use smooth easing in and out.
- Hold long enough to understand the action.
- Avoid overlapping zooms.
- Merge nearby candidates when one stable shot works better.
- Return to a useful wider view after the action.

## Manual control

The user can add a zoom block, drag its edges, move or resize the target rectangle, set strength, choose follow-cursor or fixed target, and remove it.

## QA

Check target visibility, centering, edge coverage, text readability, motion stability, timing against action, overlap, and frequency. Render proof frames at start, peak, hold, and end.

## Editorial targeting and scope

Apply [47_EDITORIAL_FIRST_CUT.md](47_EDITORIAL_FIRST_CUT.md), particularly its zoom and protected-edit rules. Plan from the committed screen-led sections after verified cuts/layouts. Reassess existing effects only inside the authorized scope; preserve approved/protected material. Name the exact target internally and record its evidence and source/layer. Skip generic center zooms and decorative motion. Use cursor-follow for moving interactions and fixed targets for stable panels, results, prices and phone screens.

Desktop scale around 1.6–1.8×, centered-phone scale around 1.8–2.0× and durations around 3–10 seconds are adjustable starting preferences, not unconditional limits. Longer holds need a readability reason. End before unrelated narration, leave short wider-view rests between unrelated targets, and never overlap zooms. Camera zooms require a clear rhetorical reason in an already camera-led section.

Use a dedicated undoable zoom pass. Inspect an interior frame, midpoint and both boundaries of every effect, including target legibility, camera/caption occlusion and protected-range integrity. Repair or remove failures before checkpointing. Tests must cover wrong-cursor tracking, empty targets, clipped text, timing/overlap, inappropriate camera zooms and stale timeline hashes. Target identity/mode/layer/verification contracts must be implemented before claiming these behaviors; the existing rectangle alone does not establish editorial intent.
