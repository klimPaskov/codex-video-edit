## Native UI fixtures

- empty Home
- three recent projects
- dependency warning
- Codex signed out
- Codex rate limit warning
- API provider key absent/rejected, secure persistence unavailable, live catalog unavailable and explicit paid-turn start
- processing in progress
- interrupted Magic Wand
- timeline with each supported selection kind
- QA pass, warning, and blocked
- export complete
- missing local asset
- recovered autosave

## Capture fixtures

Use virtual screen, microphone, camera, and loopback devices. Record known sync flashes and tones. Never rely on a developer's physical device for repeatable CI.

## Codex fixtures

Use a fake protocol server for parser and recovery tests. Keep a separate real authenticated smoke test that proves current login, model discovery, skill discovery, streamed events, and one guarded draft edit. A fake transport cannot satisfy real integration acceptance. `tests/native/codex-range-cut.test.ts` passed a guarded `cut.delete_range` across a source join, committed preview mapping, manual newest Undo and reopen first with synthetic two-source media and then with the privately combined supplied recordings, using real signed-in Codex in packaged Electron. `tests/native/codex-split.test.ts` then passed an exact `cut.split` at 0.5 seconds in a synthetic two-source draft, three-fragment live projection, exact start/split/join frames, manual Undo, reopen and immutable input checks under the same isolated packaged runtime. The first split harness asserted before asynchronous Undo settled and failed; the corrected wait passed. Focused tests reject stale, reversed and whole-draft ranges, plus split boundaries and stale heads. The native tests do not prove speech selection, continuous A/V review or export.

## API-provider fixtures

Use a local fake HTTP server for fixed-endpoint/parser/failure/timeout and key-redaction tests, with provider adapters injected only in tests. Verify no renderer or project key exposure, OS-protected storage or session-only fallback, live catalog validation, explicit paid-turn start, malicious edit-output rejection, stale transaction rejection and shared undo. The optional packaged `api-provider-live-catalog.test.ts` consumes a private guest-only key file, deletes it before launch, authenticates OpenAI model discovery and selection without generation, and checks session-only restart. Separate real authenticated OpenAI API and DeepSeek fixture turns plus packaged isolated native inspection are still required before P2 provider acceptance; fake responses and catalog discovery alone are insufficient. Keep private keys and outputs outside Git.

## User example sequence

The two user-supplied videos form one ordered final-acceptance sequence, not a unit-test fixture. Preserve and verify both hashes, keep both files outside source control, append the second after the first without rewriting either source, and record every derived artifact used for acceptance.
