# Open decisions

Resolve these through research, prototypes, or user input at the phase where they become material. Do not guess silently.

## Branding

- product name is fixed as `codex-video-edit`
- icon and visual identity
- light theme at first release or later

## Capture

- exact Windows system-audio capture path
- region capture implementation
- maximum supported resolution and frame rate
- pause representation in separate source files
- teleprompter voice-follow mode for first release

## Media

- local transcription runtime and default model
- proxy codecs and hardware acceleration policy
- preview engine and cache budget
- production audio cleanup library

## Codex

- bundled versus separately installed app-server binary
- compatible protocol version range
- default model selection rules
- consent granularity for preview frames

## Explicit API providers

- reviewed per-provider API contract and compatible live model-discovery behavior at implementation time
- OS secure-storage adapter behavior on supported Windows installations; session-only fallback when unavailable
- provider-specific edit/stream/interrupt capabilities to expose only after native verification

## Editor

- support for clip reorder outside scene groups
- transition set for the first release
- whether custom layout keyframes are needed
- maximum automatic zoom scale by canvas

## Distribution

- installer technology
- code signing
- update channel
- crash-reporting policy
- supported Windows editions and minimum hardware

## Already fixed

The lossless-first default, separate opt-in compressed modes, simplified interface, real Codex live editing, optional explicit OpenAI API and DeepSeek connections under ADR 0014, and early public GitHub development are requirements. Research may determine how to implement them, not silently remove them. No design-reference screenshot can reopen these decisions.
