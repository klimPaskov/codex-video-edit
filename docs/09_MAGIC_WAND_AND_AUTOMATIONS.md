# Magic Wand and automation specification

## Purpose

Magic Wand produces a useful first edit and offers focused one-click improvements later. It is not a decorative button and it must not hide unreviewable changes.

## Entry points

### Full Magic Edit

Available after import or recording. Default preset: Balanced.

Options:

- Clean cuts
- Captions
- Automatic zooms
- Safe speed-ups
- Audio cleanup
- Camera layout
- Cursor treatment
- Local B-roll suggestions

### Selection Magic Wand

Available in Review for the selected time range. Actions include:

- Tighten section
- Remove pause
- Improve audio
- Add zoom
- Add captions
- Suggest B-roll
- Reframe for canvas

## Operation model

Every automation emits versioned draft operations. Each operation records source evidence, intent, confidence, affected range, before state, after state, origin, and undo payload.

## Cut policy

Automatically apply only high-confidence, low-risk edits under the chosen preset. Protect names, numbers, negation, qualifications, warnings, useful pauses, uncertain words, overlapping speakers, and visible UI steps that must remain understandable.

## Live behavior

- Stream concise progress.
- Apply valid transactions to the draft as they finish.
- Keep playback usable when safe.
- Allow Stop.
- Show a compact summary such as “Removed 28 seconds, added 6 zooms, created captions.”
- Let the user review every class of change from the history filter.

## Presets

- Gentle: remove only clear dead air and failed takes.
- Balanced: normal tutorial pacing.
- Tight: stronger filler and pause cleanup, still protects meaning.
- Custom: user-selected switches and thresholds.

## Failure and uncertainty

Use the original material as fallback. Do not insert random zooms, unrelated B-roll, or speech speed-ups to make the output appear more edited.

## Mandatory editorial policy

Apply [47_EDITORIAL_FIRST_CUT.md](47_EDITORIAL_FIRST_CUT.md) and the adapted `prompts/EDITORIAL_FIRST_CUT_PROMPT.md` when implementing or running these automations. Confirm actual capabilities, active project/draft identity, authorized scope, protected material and synchronized source relationships. Reuse an existing transcription job; request a missing transcript once and retain its live job handle through polling timeouts.

The configured cue defaults to Hey Codex. Contextual variants are conservative; legacy aliases require opt-in. Quoted, ambiguous or unrelated speech remains content. Only a resolved authorized editorial direction may be removed, including its cue and associated dead time, after its edit and natural A/V join are verified. Recorded speech cannot authorize asset generation, source deletion, arbitrary execution, publication, spending or export.

The spoken pass preserves the final complete redo, useful unique context and conversational/demonstration pauses. The 200–300 ms breathing-space suggestion is contextual, never an automatic silence threshold. Verify every cut join, scan the whole source for omissions, reread the full edited transcript, and restore damaged wording through shared undo. Separate cut/layout/zoom pass groups retain live reversible commits and verified checkpoints. Graphics requests produce selective timed prompt suggestions only. This is future P5/P7/P8 acceptance work, not a current-feature claim.
