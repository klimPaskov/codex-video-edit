# ADR 0006: Isolated native testing

- Status: Accepted starting decision
- Date: 2026-09-04

## Decision

The implementation agent launches and tests the desktop application only inside its own isolated computer-use environment.

## Consequences

- Browser use is limited to research and public documentation.
- Playwright Electron provides repeatable UI automation.
- Computer use inspects the visible native window and rendered video.
- Virtual devices provide deterministic capture tests.
- Product builds, launches, and capture tests run only in the isolated guest environment.

## Historical scope resolution, 2026-09-05

The request to make the isolated environment available authorized host-side environment provisioning and a native viewer at that time. The earlier TigerVNC evidence retains that historical scope. It did not authorize a product launch on the host or mounting host personal files, credentials, devices, or display sockets into the guest.

## Current boundary, 2026-09-06

The latest user instruction prohibits control of the host PC. Under `AUTHORITATIVE_ORDER.md`, it supersedes the historical viewer exception: all native input and screenshots now remain inside Docker. Use guest X11/XTEST input and guest display capture alongside Playwright Electron. Do not operate a host viewer or capture its window; a future host-viewer session requires a new explicit user request.

The guest helper requires Linux, `/.dockerenv`, UID 1000 and display `:99`; it emits screenshots of that private guest display. This is actual native input/display evidence, not a browser substitute. Its scope remains Linux; it does not establish Windows product, capture, installer, audio-listening or high-precision display fidelity. See `docs/20_NATIVE_COMPUTER_USE_TESTING.md` and `tests/desktop/README.md` for reproducible checks.
