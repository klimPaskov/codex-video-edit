# Subagent routing

The main agent owns phase selection, integration, final judgment, and evidence. It may delegate bounded work, but it must inspect every returned result. Do not spawn GPT-6 Astra subagents under any circumstances, including native Codex child tests. If a permitted non-Astra model cannot be selected or verified, do the work directly or report that test unavailable.

| Need | Subagent | Required skill |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current product and technical research | `researcher` | `research-product` |
| Flow, visual hierarchy, and simple screens | `ux-designer` | `simple-desktop-ui` |
| Electron process and IPC design | `desktop-architect` | `native-electron` |
| Codex protocol, auth, threads, and tools | `codex-bridge-engineer` | `codex-app-server`, `timeline-editor` |
| OpenAI API, DeepSeek and Gemini API fixed-endpoint adapters, model discovery and guarded output | `codex-bridge-engineer` with `security-reviewer` | `codex-app-server`, `security-privacy`, `timeline-editor` |
| Screen, audio, camera, and sync capture | `recording-engineer` | `recording-capture` |
| FFmpeg, transcription, rendering, and media QA | `media-engineer` | `media-engine` |
| Timeline interactions and history | `editor-engineer` | `timeline-editor` |
| Magic Wand, zooms, speed, and B-roll plans | `automation-editor` | `magic-edit`, `automatic-zoom` |
| Native launch, Playwright, and computer-use review | `native-qa` | `native-app-testing` |
| Threat model, permissions, and privacy | `security-reviewer` | `security-privacy` |
| Installer and release | `release-engineer` | `release-packaging` |
| Cross-file updates and traceability | `spec-maintainer` | `spec-sync` |

## Routing rules

For the ADR 0013 project shell, keep domain/store/complete-probe verification, main/preload IPC, renderer interaction, and spec/native evidence ownership bounded by explicit files. Renderer work consumes only the path-free committed `ProjectView`; it must not create its own persistence model or fake project/revision identities. The main agent verifies pure postcommit mapping, save-failure preservation, and native five-stage interaction before integration. Project/source/timeline/revision schema shapes remain authoritative; extended IPC, examples and tests must stay synchronized. P2 shared transactions remain a separate prerequisite and must serve manual and Codex edits alike.

For P2, the Codex bridge engineer may own a bounded guarded-tool or thread-runtime file set,
but the main agent owns the active project/draft scope, transaction integration, and final
protocol review. Generate the consumed experimental protocol from the pinned binary, retain
its private provenance, compile request objects against the reviewed generated closure, and
validate security-relevant response fields before projection. The packaged MCP child may
only forward the fixed tool name and bounded input to the authenticated main-owned broker;
it never becomes a second transaction writer.

Native Codex children are separate from implementation subagents. The bridge engineer tests the actual parent collaboration item, child thread/read history and inherited policy privately. The parent project stream filters ordinary child notifications without projecting child content; malformed identities and forbidden methods remain fail-closed. A model statement or generic drawer activity never proves a native child ran.

- Delegate only a clear file or evidence boundary.
- Give the subagent exact task IDs, inputs, outputs, and stop conditions.
- Do not let two agents edit the same file at once.
- A subagent may not mark a phase complete.
- Research agents do not decide architecture alone.
- Visual agents do not weaken product, privacy, accessibility, or testing requirements.
- QA agents must reproduce claims from the current build.
- When a task changes a workflow contract, always route a final pass to `spec-maintainer`.

## Fidelity, reference, and publishing ownership

The media engineer owns `lossless-media` checks across capture, intermediate rendering, and export. The UX designer and native QA agent use `reference-fidelity` for the current individual references and their correction notes. The release engineer uses `open-source-development` from P0 onward, not only at release. The parent reviews all changes and verifies remote publication.

For five-stage navigation changes, the UX designer and native QA agent verify Edit separately from Review, with comparison and QA inside Review. The Codex bridge engineer and security reviewer verify that authorized active-draft edits and export staging do not require repeated confirmation, while final export and forbidden effects remain outside the AI tool surface.

## Editorial policy ownership

For `docs/47_EDITORIAL_FIRST_CUT.md` and `docs/prompts/EDITORIAL_FIRST_CUT_PROMPT.md`, route source/synchronization/transcription-job evidence to the media and recording engineers; conservative spoken-cue, retake/coherence and pass planning to `automation-editor`; shared sequence/hash/undo/checkpoint behavior to the editor and Codex bridge engineers; approved-layout/occlusion and suggestion-only opportunity records to the automation/editor specialists; and actual joins, boundary/midpoint/interior renders and whole-video checks to `native-qa`. The security reviewer checks quoted/ambiguous cues, permission expansion, protected edits and unauthorized asset/export side effects. `spec-maintainer` closes the task/schema/example/prompt/skill/traceability sync.

Pass explicit source scope, verified synchronized sets, current timeline identity and evidence requirements. Do not delegate operation of the reference editor, invent unavailable tools, create graphics from a recorded cue, or infer completion from planning. Codex and ADRs 0014/0015's three explicit API providers share one guarded draft history; an API key grants no Codex-native capabilities. The main agent reviews the measured final report and every claimed pass, leaving later feature acceptance incomplete until proved.
