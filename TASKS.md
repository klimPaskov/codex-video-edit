# Ordered implementation backlog

Complete phases in order. A task is complete only when its acceptance evidence exists.

## P0: research, decisions, and repository foundation

- [x] P0-01 Read all package sources and current official documentation.
- [x] P0-02 Research Borumi and comparable recorders without copying protected assets.
- [x] P0-03 Confirm current Electron, Playwright, FFmpeg, local transcription, and Codex app-server contracts.
- [x] P0-04 Establish the monorepo, strict TypeScript, tests, linting, formatting, schemas, phase result writer, and minimum packaged local product shell with sandboxed typed IPC needed for native foundation acceptance (ADR 0012).
- [x] P0-05 Accept or revise ADRs with evidence.
- [x] P0-06 Generate and decode a short media fixture, including an exact lossless round trip; import it through the actual native product into an immutable managed library and verify bounded frame transport, seek, persistence, and explicit unsupported-preview behavior (ADR 0012).
- [x] P0-07 Resolve the authenticated owner and create or verify the public `codex-video-edit` repository. Publish reviewed source, specs, licence, and CI without private media.
- [x] P0-08 Establish tested capture, intermediate, preview, and master fidelity profiles and reject silent downgrades.

Accepted: all eight tasks are recorded in `docs/workflow/results/P0.json` against published revision `8fe7c4bcbe8511ac8772c043ff023b15075ad823`. P0 acceptance is retained; P1 acceptance is recorded below.

ADR 0012 moves only the minimum actual native shell and immutable media bootstrap into P0 to satisfy its native gate. The infrastructure probe is not product evidence. P1 shell/navigation/accessibility is independently accepted below. P2 Codex integration, P3 projects/drafts/A/V playback, P4 capture, and all later acceptance remain required.

## P1: secure native shell and simple design system

- [x] P1-01 Build a packaged Electron window that never opens as a normal browser page.
- [x] P1-02 Use local packaged renderer content, context isolation, sandboxing, CSP, and a narrow typed preload API.
- [x] P1-03 Implement Home, the five-step header (Record or Import, Auto Edit, Edit, Review, Export), modal system, toast system, and one-panel-at-a-time layout. Include the real project create/open foundation, source-matched initial timeline and baseline revision, and persisted active stage needed for honest project navigation (ADR 0013).
- [x] P1-04 Keep logs, Ready badges, status footers, repeated titles, and obvious descriptions out of normal screens. Apply the current reference correction notes.
- [x] P1-05 Add keyboard navigation, scaling, focus states, and visual regression fixtures.
- [x] P1-06 Launch and inspect the native window with Playwright Electron and computer use.

Accepted: all six tasks are recorded in `docs/workflow/results/P1.json` against verified published revision `33d3fdc1d87787322c658fad88a1c4fa9787f2d1`. Actual packaged Linux guest tests and computer-use inspection cover the simple shell, real project navigation, recovery, focus/scaling and scoped Orca output. Windows/hardware and later editing acceptance remain required. P2 is the first incomplete dependency-safe phase.

ADR 0013 brings only the necessary project foundation forward from P3. Stage navigation persists actual project presentation state without executing features, modifying draft history, certifying review, or starting export. Verify all five transitions and reopen against the same project, source and draft state. Unimplemented stage actions remain absent or truthfully unavailable; navigation is not evidence that later features work.

## P2: real Codex runtime and explicit API providers

- [ ] P2-01 Spawn the official Codex app-server over stdio and implement initialize lifecycle and restart recovery.
  Partial packaged evidence: the authenticated Luna/high native fixture restarted only the pinned App Server child of its Electron main process, used the existing Settings Reconnect action, and resumed the same dynamic project thread with matching history and unchanged journal/source/baseline. The child was stopped only after prior turns were settled; in-flight mutation recovery remains unverified, so this task and the P2 phase remain incomplete.
- [ ] P2-02 Add ChatGPT-managed browser and optional device-code login, logout, account state, and rate-limit display. Keep the one-time device code in the explicit Settings attempt only; require an actual completion callback and reconciled signed-in account before claiming managed login completion.
  Partial browser-flow evidence: a packaged Electron test against the real pinned App Server rejected a mismatched callback state, processed a matching `access_denied`, returned to signed out with fixed recovery text, redacted provider detail, and allowed retry/cancel. This is failure-path evidence only; successful browser OAuth completion remains unverified. Device-code completion and signed-in reopen are separately recorded in `docs/workflow/progress/P2.md`.
- [ ] P2-03 Discover models, reasoning options, skills, and skill changes at runtime. A fresh ChatGPT preference defaults to live-catalog GPT-6-Luna/high under ADR 0016; preserve explicit choices and show a recovery state when that pair is unavailable. The `0.155.1` packaged GPT-6-Luna/high Settings and guarded restore-range fixtures passed; full P2 acceptance remains separately gated.
- [ ] P2-04 Implement durable project threads, streaming items, interrupt, retry, and compact user-facing activity. Filter native child notifications from the parent projection and require correlated server history before claiming a subagent ran.
- [ ] P2-05 Implement the guarded codex-video-edit MCP tool server and shared validated transaction engine, including expected draft sequence, durable journal, atomic persistence, deterministic inverse/undo, redo-stack replay, and committed-transaction recovery required by the real fixture edit (ADR 0013). Partial native Edit controls now route playhead trim, split, a marked ripple range cut, newest undo and stacked redo through this same journal, with committed clip-map refresh. Packaged synthetic Electron verifies manual Redo through IPC before and after project reopen, with exact decoded preview and immutable-input checks. The guarded Codex and fixed API-provider surfaces also expose reversible `cut.split` and bounded `cut.delete_range` over that reducer; the earlier seven-tool dynamic-route inventory, stale/invalid-range rejection, real Codex cross-source native preview and shared Undo passed on synthetic and supplied footage. Real Codex split passed on synthetic and the supplied two-source footage with live fragment projection, exact frames, Undo and reopen; the latter private run used Luna/high on the current official runtime after the fixture passed. Complete guarded-tool policy and editorial pass groups, current sequence/hash preconditions and truthful verified checkpoints in docs/47_EDITORIAL_FIRST_CUT.md.
  - Partial shared-transaction evidence: guarded `cut.delete_ranges` now commits 2–16 disjoint descending half-open time cuts atomically with one Undo. Focused reducer/service/schema tests and packaged Luna/high synthetic and private supplied-footage runs passed committed preview, manual Undo, reopen and immutable inputs; the supplied native window was visually inspected. This is direct time-based structural editing, not transcript-based selection, listened A/V join review, a verified spoken-pass checkpoint, full tool confinement or P2 acceptance.
- [ ] P2-06 Prove a real authenticated Codex turn can inspect a fixture project and apply a draft-only edit. Bootstrap read tools on create/resume with the main-owned validated project identity; obtain current draft identifiers, sequence and hash through those tools before mutation.
  Partial native evidence: the fresh-profile range-batch fixture matches the exact completed App Server turn, requires successful active-project reads before one guarded mutation with current sequence/hash, and verifies committed preview, shared Undo, reopen and immutable inputs. A separate supplied-footage run passed the same structural batch. Each new dynamic thread now binds every guarded tool's `project_id` schema property to the selected main-owned project with JSON Schema `const`; focused tests cover all eight tools, invalid IDs, and thread-start wiring, while the main active-project and freshness checks remain authoritative. A fresh packaged Luna/high synthetic split with hostile Apps configuration passed committed-during-turn, exact frames, shared Undo, reopen and immutable inputs. Existing MCP-bound schemas are unchanged. Meaning, audio, complete tool-confinement and export gates remain open.
- [ ] P2-07 Reject fake responses and stale protocol assumptions. Distinguish offline guarded-service freshness on a real Codex edit from live stdio error relay, bounded native non-use of a forbidden command from complete tool unavailability, and child responses against parent-validated summary state after a completed spawn/wait. The 0.155.1 Luna route disables the supported plan and user-input tools and unrelated external tools; it also disables API-key model discovery, permission/rule requests, web search, MCP auth/dependency installation, passive screen memory, external-agent memory import, persisted goals, and plugin suggestions; MCP-bound threads keep native agents disabled; dynamic-bound Codex selects V1 or V2 only from live model metadata. GPT-6-Luna V2 uses direct-only spawn/wait functions with root-plus-one-child capacity, main-owned spawn/activity correlation, and parent-read project/timeline snapshots passed to the child because per-thread editor tools are not inherited. An earlier packaged V1 native child test covers receiver-ID completion races and both child-owned summary reads. The new GPT-6-Luna V2 packaged native test correlates the direct spawn call ID to subAgentActivity, verifies child parent/source and a completed child report against parent-read path-free summary state, and preserves read-only/no-network/never-approval policy with unchanged source, baseline and journal. The isolated guest screenshot was visually reviewed and shows the packaged Electron window with a single Codex drawer, synthetic preview and no browser chrome or persistent Ready badge. Separate direct App Server probes passed one namespaced host-defined tool with no MCP server, an owned-only bounded code-mode inventory, and one process-restart/thread-resume call. These tests do not establish the complete effective tool catalog or old MCP-thread migration; the task remains open. The packaged bridge now discovers configured MCP names, disables each with a per-server override, validates the exact inventory before and after thread start/resume, and explicitly disables Apps/plugins/remote plugins on both thread methods. The authenticated synthetic hostile-config child fixture passed. Earlier V1 dynamic split fixtures verified seven editor tools plus five V1 collaboration functions. The current GPT-6-Luna V2 nested surface verifies eight guarded editor tools, zero nested child functions, zero Apps/other tools, and only the read-only clock helper; a separate packaged native V2 fixture verifies direct spawn/wait, child lineage, parent-read summaries and unchanged draft/source state. A fresh profile with `[apps._default].enabled = true` and `[apps.adobe].enabled = true` passed split, Undo, reopen and immutable-input checks. This bounded nested surface does not establish the complete upstream effective-tool catalog; the task remains open.
  Pinned-source supplement: Codex 0.155.1 also enables `sleep_tool` and `view_image` by default, and `code_mode_only` does not suppress its direct sleep tool. The process launch and both route-derived thread requests explicitly disable those two features and have exact launch, start and resume assertions. The packaged Luna/high synthetic split and native child-read regressions passed after the change; one earlier fresh turn supplied a mismatched project ID, was safely rejected, and made no journal change. Complete effective-tool confinement remains open.
  Partial boundary note: the host-defined boundary validates and projects only the then-current seven reviewed tool names. A validated owned `turn/started` notification can correlate a host call before the `turn/start` response; unknown, terminal and contradictory turns fail closed in unit tests. A direct live client run completed one owned read without MCP. Packaged main now selects this route for new conversations and keeps MCP for older bindings; complete effective confinement remains open.
  One direct isolated live turn using that six-tool adapter received its validated `turn/start` response before one correlated read-only host call. Earlier runs with an older package lacking its code-mode host made no call. One passing order does not establish every race, legacy migration or packaged draft routing.
  The main-owned registry tags new bindings as MCP or dynamic and decodes legacy records as MCP without rewriting on read. Unit tests reject cross-route resume/calls and unknown routes. Packaged MCP trim/Undo/reopen/interruption and synthetic v1 same-thread read passed; a later product write preserved that old binding in v2. The second broad edit harness failed after a correct trim and is not a full pass. A subsequent packaged Luna/high dynamic-route run passed guarded trim during the turn, exact committed preview, same-thread/history reopen, real Codex Undo, exact restored preview, Stop and source/baseline integrity; guest-only visual inspection confirmed the actual native window. The same new package also reopened a v1 MCP conversation and completed an owned read without changing its legacy binding. A copy-based first legacy test failed because the project baseline stores absolute local paths; the passing test used the original isolated config with a restored registry backup. Complete effective confinement remains open.
  A route-aware stale continuation from that actual dynamic edit/Undo fixture also passed: an obsolete sequence/hash was rejected by the offline guarded service and by one live App Server host-defined `cut_trim_edge` call. The correlated completed turn reported a failed tool result; current draft, both journal records, original, managed source and baseline stayed unchanged. This proves live stale-error relay for the tested host route, not every forbidden-tool boundary.
  An earlier route-aware packaged Luna/high two-source split run required a model-visible inventory of exactly six owned and zero unowned nested code-mode tools before the guarded split; that inventory described the previous catalog. A later fresh packaged Luna/high split run checked the then-current seven-tool inventory and passed committed split, shared Undo and reopen. Synthetic media and the two private user-supplied recordings in requested order also passed the guarded split with exact split/join frames, reopen, immutable sources/baseline and guest-only native inspection. These are bounded run results; complete effective-tool confinement and P2 acceptance remain open.
  Partial route-feature-policy evidence: focused tests verify one shared feature policy for thread/start and thread/resume: MCP preserves code_mode_only=false, omits dynamic-only enable flags, and keeps native collaboration off; the dynamic Codex route enables code mode and the packaged host with in-process fallback disabled and supports the depth-1 v1 child path. The packaged synthetic Luna/high split fixture passed after one earlier visual-hold timeout; the passing rerun correlated the code-mode call/output, observed seven editor and five child functions with zero app or other functions, committed split, shared Undo/reopen, and preserved source/baseline bytes. The actual Electron window and Codex drawer were inspected in the guest. This remains bounded partial evidence; full upstream confinement and phase acceptance remain open.
  Partial negative-policy evidence: after the expanded 0.155.1 feature gates, a fresh packaged Luna/high command-policy turn completed with no command, file, dynamic, or unrequested call/item. Its account-contained rollout matched the exact user turn; sandbox/approval metadata and immutable synthetic project bytes were checked. The harness keeps `effectiveToolUnavailabilityProven: false`, so this remains a bounded behavior observation and the task stays open.
- [ ] P2-08 Add fixed-endpoint OpenAI API, DeepSeek and Gemini API key connections beside Codex (ADRs 0014 and 0015). Keep key entry and provider network calls in main, use OS-backed encryption or session-only fallback, and never expose key material in renderer state, projects, logs or Git. Gemini function-call thought signatures stay bounded and transient in main.
- [ ] P2-09 Discover and validate each API provider's supported models at runtime, separate ChatGPT subscription and API billing/usage labels, and show only verified provider capabilities. Keep a remembered model choice with its protected key and revalidate it after restart; session-only choices do not persist. Require an explicit user action before a paid generation turn; do not fabricate quotas or prices.
- [ ] P2-10 Route an authenticated API-provider fixture turn through the same guarded draft transaction engine as Codex, Magic Wand and manual edits. Prove committed-state projection, freshness rejection, shared undo, source immutability, provider failure recovery, key redaction and packaged isolated native behavior. Retain the original Codex smoke gates.

Current bounded evidence (2026-09-26; all P2 tasks remain incomplete):

- Model default: the authenticated 0.155.1 model catalog returned gpt-6-luna with high; the packaged Settings regression passed across two launches. ADR 0016, the app default, native assertions, skill guidance, and selector spec now use that live-validated pair. Saved valid explicit choices still take precedence.
- Shared transaction restore: cut.restore_range accepts one exact missing source-time interval, replays and shares Undo with manual, Codex, and API-provider mutations. Reducer/service/MCP/schema/API parity, restore/reopen/undo, and immutable-input tests pass. Packaged GPT-6-Luna/high Electron restored the guarded interval during a real turn, updated committed preview/duration, shared-Undo restored the cut, and reopen reproduced the expected frame/duration with original and baseline bytes unchanged.
- Tool-surface security: the fresh hostile-app GPT-6-Luna/high inventory correlated the exact code-mode call/output: eight guarded editor functions, zero app functions, zero nested V1/V2 child functions under the direct-only V2 policy; the direct V2 spawn/wait path is verified by a separate native fixture, and only clock__curr_time outside the owned editor names. A guarded split, Undo, reopen, preview, and immutable-source checks passed. A separate packaged GPT-5.6-Luna/high fixture completed the supported V1 child spawn/wait and bounded project/timeline reads with inherited read-only/no-network/never-approval policy and unchanged journal/sources. GPT-6-Luna V2 now passes a packaged direct spawn/wait and path-free summary snapshot handoff with server-owned child correlation. Child dynamic editor tools are not inherited; the parent supplies both validated summaries, and main still rejects every child mutation. Full effective-tool confinement and whole-phase acceptance remain open.

The clean isolated Docker workspace passed npm run check: 42 foundation tests, 315 media tests, 43 schema/example pairs, and delivery validation with 20 reference images; the current Electron package was built and the native GPT-6 restore/split and V1 child fixtures passed. Account files, media, raw rollout, screenshots, and result JSON remain in the guest; no new visual computer-use inspection was performed. No P2 task checkbox or phase result is written.

Acceptance: the real Codex smoke and all three explicit API-provider security, discovery and guarded-edit paths pass, or the phase remains incomplete with exact evidence. No P2 task is marked complete solely by this requirement change.

Use P1's actual project foundation and the shared transaction engine for the authenticated fixture edit. Do not substitute an AI-only state store or fake project. P3 and P6 retain their full acceptance even where their foundations were implemented earlier.

## P3: projects, import, media model, and preview

- [ ] P3-01 Create project storage, source manifests, autosave, locks, and recovery.
- [ ] P3-02 Import and hash media without mutating it.
- [ ] P3-03 Probe streams and build edit, audio, and thumbnail proxies.
- [ ] P3-04 Implement the canonical microsecond timeline and deterministic frame conversion. Partial foundations now include a verified source PTS/final-packet boundary and an ordered two-source fragment map with trim/split/ripple-cut/undo; synchronized A/V, canonical multi-source render and broader timing/format fixtures remain open.
- [ ] P3-05 Build smooth preview playback with source-to-output mapping.
- [ ] P3-06 Add recent projects, open, rename, duplicate, archive, and delete-project safeguards.

The append-only library and native still-frame path now cover verified BGRA and a narrow tagged 8-bit H.264/BT.709 display profile. A compatible two-source project can be created in order, reopened and edited through the shared journal. The import, probe, timeline and playback tasks stay open for the full format matrix, rational/VFR render timing, additional sources, continuous synchronized A/V preview, and canonical render separation.

Acceptance: an imported fixture reopens and previews identically.

## P4: recording studio

- [ ] P4-01 Capture display, window, and selected region.
- [ ] P4-02 Capture microphone, optional system audio, and optional camera.
- [ ] P4-03 Record sources separately against one monotonic clock and persist sync evidence.
- [ ] P4-04 Implement countdown, pause, resume, stop, recovery, and global shortcuts.
- [ ] P4-05 Implement scenes, teleprompter, retries, take history, and take selection.
- [ ] P4-06 Capture consented pointer and click telemetry without recording keystrokes.
- [ ] P4-07 Test with virtual media devices and label hardware gaps honestly.

Acceptance: a virtual-device scene becomes a synchronized editable project.

## P5: transcription, raw cut, and Magic Wand

- [ ] P5-01 Run local word-timed transcription and silence detection. Reuse existing transcription jobs and request missing transcription once; preserve job identity through polling timeouts.
- [ ] P5-02 Implement transcript correction and transcript-linked cuts.
- [ ] P5-03 Detect silence, filler, false starts, repeated takes, mistakes, and protected speech. Apply the editorial policy: conservative configured cues and opt-in legacy variants, ambiguity retention, final complete retakes, unique context, protected edits and verified synchronized cut sets.
- [ ] P5-04 Implement Magic Wand presets and a live non-destructive operation stream.
- [ ] P5-05 Apply a useful initial raw cut with undo and a readable change summary. Verify every join, complete the separate whole-source omission pass and full edited-transcript reread, and restore failed joins before the spoken-pass checkpoint.
- [ ] P5-06 Stop safely and recover an interrupted automation.

Acceptance: Magic Wand improves a fixture while preserving meaning and source bytes. Apply docs/47_EDITORIAL_FIRST_CUT.md: fixtures must cover quoted/ambiguous/variant cues, unauthorized spoken requests, independent screen sources, protected material, incomplete latest retakes, meaningful pauses, every-join checks, whole-transcript passes, restoration and idempotent job lifecycle.

## P6: simple editor

- [ ] P6-01 Implement select, split, trim, ripple delete, restore, move, snap, undo, and redo. Partial native Edit controls now trim or split the current clip at the playhead, mark an output-time range for ripple deletion across fragments or sources, and use newest Undo plus stack-ordered Redo from the durable journal. Packaged synthetic Electron verifies Redo before and after reopen with exact preview and immutable-input checks; broader selection, restore beyond newest Undo, move, snap, and full A/V edit flows remain open.
- [ ] P6-02 Implement fixed screen, camera, audio, B-roll, text, and caption tracks with collapsible detail.
- [ ] P6-03 Show only the inspector for the current selection or tool.
- [ ] P6-04 Add selection-aware Codex commands that update the same draft history.
- [ ] P6-05 Implement autosave, revision commit, revision compare, and crash recovery.
- [ ] P6-06 Test mouse, keyboard, and accessibility editing flows.

Acceptance: a user can correct the Magic Wand draft without leaving the app.

## P7: zoom, cursor, speed, and reframe

- [ ] P7-01 Generate purposeful automatic zooms from telemetry and visual evidence. Record precise target identity, source/layer and fixed/cursor mode; apply contextual scale/duration/rest preferences within authorized scope.
- [ ] P7-02 Implement manual zoom creation and on-canvas target editing.
- [ ] P7-03 Implement smooth cursor, click highlight, cursor visibility, and per-range controls.
- [ ] P7-04 Detect safe typing, loading, and waiting ranges for speed-up.
- [ ] P7-05 Implement manual speed segments with pitch-safe audio choices.
- [ ] P7-06 Implement 16:9, 9:16, 1:1, 4:5, and custom canvas reframing.
- [ ] P7-07 Add boundary, centering, edge, motion, speech, and A/V QA. Verify every zoom at boundaries, midpoint and interior against its named target, camera occlusion and protected material.

Acceptance: automatic effects improve focus and remain directly adjustable. The editorial policy additionally requires named/evidenced targets, fixed/cursor selection, no overlap or decorative motion, authorized-scope preservation and per-effect visual verification.

## P8: captions, layouts, B-roll, elements, and audio

- [ ] P8-01 Implement captions, styling, safe areas, correction, and sidecars.
- [ ] P8-02 Implement screen-only, camera bubble, side-by-side, presenter, and custom layouts. Reuse approved layout properties, avoid evidence/caption occlusion, prefer purposeful sections and verify both boundaries/midpoint before checkpointing.
- [ ] P8-03 Implement text, image, shape, overlay, and simple transition elements. Keep editorial motion-graphics opportunities suggestion-only with final-cut intervals and complete grounded prompts; asset creation/import requires a separate explicit request.
- [ ] P8-04 Index local B-roll and music with provenance and searchable metadata.
- [ ] P8-05 Let Codex suggest and place local B-roll with source fallback.
- [ ] P8-06 Implement noise cleanup, loudness, fades, gain, music, and speech-priority ducking.
- [ ] P8-07 Implement asset relink and missing-media recovery.

Acceptance: a composed segment renders with licensed local assets and clear speech. Also verify approved-layout reuse, PiP collision avoidance, section boundaries/midpoints, complete final-timed graphics suggestions and absence of unauthorized asset side effects under docs/47_EDITORIAL_FIRST_CUT.md.

## P9: review, QA, export, and installer

- [ ] P9-01 Implement review flags, compare, revision history, and final watch-through state.
- [ ] P9-02 Run complete media, timing, audio, caption, asset, zoom, speed, and visual QA. Include whole-video analysis scans, precise A/V checks, protected-range preservation and actual measured editorial counts/checkpoint status.
- [ ] P9-03 Implement the default FFV1/PCM lossless master, exact decoded-sample validation, caption sidecars, and an explicitly chosen smaller MP4 export.
- [ ] P9-04 Verify output hash and full decode before success.
- [ ] P9-05 Build a Windows installer, clean uninstall, and update plan.
- [ ] P9-06 Run security, privacy, accessibility, recovery, and performance checks.

Acceptance: the installed app creates and verifies the default lossless master and the optional compressed sharing profile. Source media remains unchanged.

## P10: user example video acceptance

- [ ] P10-01 Import both supplied example videos through the native UI, preserve each immutable source, and append the second after the first in one editable draft sequence.
- [ ] P10-02 Run Magic Wand with real Codex and inspect each automation class. Exercise the adapted editorial prompt, including conservative spoken instructions and suggestion-only graphics with no automatic export.
- [ ] P10-03 Review the complete draft through computer use.
- [ ] P10-04 Fix defects using manual tools and natural-language edits.
- [ ] P10-05 Export and fully decode the lossless master, verify canonical frame and audio equality, and test a separately requested smaller MP4 copy.
- [ ] P10-06 Save screenshots, short recordings, logs, manifests, and a concise acceptance report. Include unresolved instructions, final-timed graphics prompts, measured layout/zoom purposes and targets, persisted/checkpoint state and remaining review.
- [ ] P10-07 Update every affected spec, skill, task, schema, and reference entry.

Acceptance: `docs/workflow/results/P10.json` records the exact final evidence and known limits.
